## Kernel patches and config for the Joggler

Here are the kernel patches and configs I use to build the Linux kernels I
run on my Joggler.

The patches are updated versions of the ones found on
[Andrew's site](http://birdslikewires.co.uk/download/openframe/kernel/).

## How to build

Follow the steps from the Debian Linux Kernel Handbook,
(4.5. Building a custom kernel from Debian kernel source)[https://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-common-tasks.html#s-common-building].
